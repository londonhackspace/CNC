# To do

## Todo points

* Finish `ansible_playbook.yaml` stage 1: until reboot 
    * adapt dependency checking to notice when machine is rebooted, suggestion: create a file on the /chroot/cnc/ somewhere (e.g. `echo "# Generated by stage 1 from https://github.com/londonhackspace/CNC" > /chroot/cnc/etc/is-CNC-computer`) and rely on that file being on the machine without the chroot/cnc prefix after reboot
    * copy `authorized_keys` from this repo (add your own ssh public keys) to `/chroot/cnc/root/.ssh/` (need to create this directory with 0700 permissions or ssh won't let you log in) or/and set a root password in the chroot before reboot, otherwise can't continue afterwards (suggestion: add the authorized file to the Git repo and take it from there)
    * need to "wait" until rebooted, i.e. retry logging in, or have the first vs. second stages run separately manually
* Finish `ansible_playbook.yaml` stage 2: actions after reboot. NOTE: perhaps it would be better to have different .yaml files for the two stages, so that they can be run separately manually. For a start, anyway. (How do you chain the two playbooks though (without merging them into one again) when wanting to have a one-action process in the future? You can always figure this out later though.)
    * add the the customisation of the Log on screen to ansibile 
        * https://wiki.debian.org/LightDM
    * Configuration of connection to machine, and spindle settings and storing these 
    * Spindle measurement and recording
    * Logging the Spindle measurement and recording
    * Confirm setup of local groups for access etc

* disk image from gantry cnc on lattner:  unpack (where?), mount, see where the spindle logging stuff is (unless easier to do from the above)
